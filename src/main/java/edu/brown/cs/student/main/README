Project 1
aclark21, yhayash2, wlee41
total time: (ariana: ~50 hours, Yuki: , Wonyoung: )
API Questions:
- On average it should take about 2 seconds to get the right answer
- I am going to verify my answer 3 times
- The upper limit on the number of API calls is going to be 10

**Design Choices**:
API: I decided to make my API Aggregator (API.java class) test the following:
1. Speed, if the link takes less than 2 seconds
*if I had time:
2. I would add another method that checks for a non-error message by running the endpoints through a loop of 10 until there is not a malicious error
3. I would also like to add a method that checks to make sure that some of the endpoints dont go rogue and show data thats not from their type
Errors/bugs:

Tests:
- (KD-tree): Created system tests for each command, similar and classify. Also made test suite for possible errors for
    both of the commands
- (API): Did not create tests

How to:
- Run the tests:
    - KD-tree: run ./cs32-test src/test/system/KD-tree/*.test
    - KD-tree-error: run ./cs32-test src/test/system/KD-tree-error/*.test

-Build and run your program:
    - Build: mvn package
